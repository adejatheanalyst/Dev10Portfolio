# Features to Style
## UI elements and pages to style include:

##  Navigation. 
    [X] The main navigation appears at the top of the page, but that's not a hard requirement. 
        It could be a sidebar or something else. It's up to you.
## Home. 

    [X] The home or "landing" view is displayed when the app starts. 


    It currently displays an h1 containing the app name "Field Agent Web". 
    Feel free to add more content. Make it your own.
## Display all agents. 
    [X] Click the "Agents" navigation link to view a table of all agents. 
    (If you don't see any agents displayed, use MySQL Workbench to confirm that your field_agent database has data in the agent table.) 
    Style the table and its contents. Optionally convert the table to a card layout (one card per agent).
## Add an agent. 
    [X] Click the "Add Agent" button on the agents view to display the form for adding an agent.
    [X] Style the form and its contents.
##  Update an agent. 
    [X] Click the "Edit" button on the agents view to display the form for updating an agent. 
        The same form is used for adding and updating agents, so you only need to style it once.
##  Delete an agent. 
    [x] Click the "Delete" button on the agents view to display a confirmation view.
    [x] Style the contents of the confirmation view.
