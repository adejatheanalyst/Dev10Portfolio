# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  Refactor the app to use Route, Link and NavLink elements instead of toggling state to show/hide components.
  Implement the following routes:
  / displays a Home page
  /contact displays a Contact page
  /solarpanels displays all of the solar panels
  /solarpanels/add displays the SolarPanelForm - 
- If your app does not have a SolarPanelForm component yet, build one out.
- Use accessible and semantic HTML for your form.
